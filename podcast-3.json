This podcast is supported by advertising outside the UK. War, famine, death and pestilence. I think we've got the lot covered on Inside Science this week in the podcast. Hello, I'm Marnie Chesterton and this podcast originally aired on the 20th of July, 2023. Cerberus, the three-headed dog who guards the gates of hell, has now also lent its name to the hellish heatwave over southern Europe. We'll be looking at the consequences as this type of event becomes more frequent. And you don't know what weather is coming unless you monitor it. Inside Science went to play with some massive balloons for science. They'll get to roughly the size of a small car basically. Then they'll burst. And not in my backyard, we've got the tips to make your garden climate change resilient. You can make a difference. The first thing, the most important thing to do is to keep your garden. Just one square metre of concrete produces 260 kilograms of carbon dioxide. So whatever you do, don't concrete over your lawn and don't replace it with that horrible astroturf stuff. Also, naval warfare. As the bridge to Crimea was attacked this week, I look at the latest weaponry lurking under the waves. But first, there's probably a word in German for the relief you might feel at not currently being on holiday. Or at least there should be. Suggestions welcome please. Because this week, the news has been full of the heat dome sitting on most of southern Europe. Temperatures in the high 40s in Sardinia, wildfires in Greece, Spain also burning. It was this very week last year when the UK faced its own record breaking temperatures. And we on Inside Science looked at the knock-on consequences. Well, we're doing it again. But this time we've gone international. So first up, groceries. How is this abnormal weather event affecting the crops that end up in our shops? Joining me is Rebecca Toby from the Food Foundation. Welcome to Inside Science. Hi, great to be here. Rebecca, can we talk about our fiver day? How much do we import? Just under half of our veg, 47% and 84% of our fruit we currently get from overseas. Specifically, what is at risk from climate change? There's a real concern at the minute that the extreme weather we're seeing will have an impact on the UK's food security. So I don't know how many of you remember Tomato Gate earlier this year when we saw sort of widespread shortages of products like peppers and tomatoes on the supermarket shelves. Those shortages that we saw back then were in part driven by extreme weather in Spain and North Africa, which affected the harvests. So it's quite likely that the weather that we're seeing at the minute in Europe is going to impact on food supplies over the next few months. So all of the nice Mediterranean diet items that we're told to eat more of? It's a particular problem because we know that actually not very many of us at all get our fiver day in the UK. But these are foods that are really important as part of a healthy diet, but also have quite a low environmental impact compared to other foods. So, you know, we should be eating more of them. The weather at the minute is likely to kind of reduce supply. It may well drive up prices, which is another concern. So, you know, I think it's the next food price crisis is very likely to be driven by the climate crisis. And that will disproportionately impact on low income groups. Do you think that events like the heat dome in southern Europe are going to negatively impact fruit and veg production around the world because they are unpredictable events? They will absolutely impact on the amount of food that we're able to produce, even though there might be some crops that are easier to grow, for example, in the northern hemisphere going forward. If it warms up, you know, we get such a large proportion of our food, particularly fruit and veg, from certain areas of the world. Thank you, Rebecca Toby from the Food Foundation. Moving on, we do know that in future crops will be affected by more extreme weather conditions. But what is less sure is where and when events like the Cerberus heat dome will occur. One factor that affects this unusual behaviour is a wobbly jet stream. To find out more, I spoke with Hayley Fowler, Professor of Climate Change Impact at Newcastle University. First question, what exactly is the jet stream? So the jet stream is quite a high level wind and it's controlled by the temperature gradients between the equator and the poles. So obviously the poles are quite a bit less warm than the equator and that difference in temperature drives this wind system in the mid latitudes. So we know that the poles are warming faster than other bits of the earth. What effect is that having on the jet stream? So this reduces the difference in the temperature between the equator and the poles and it weakens the jet stream. And that weaker jet stream then can meander more so it can kind of become more wavy and go higher in latitude and down more towards the equator than it has done previously. Can you give me examples of where the meandering in the jet stream has caused differences in the weather conditions? So when we can see this playing out in the real world at the moment, for example, the heat dome that we're seeing over Texas, that's a meander in the jet stream and it's trapping all of that heat in one place. But there's also one, of course, in Europe, particularly over North Africa and southern Europe, that's causing all the extreme temperatures that we're seeing in the Mediterranean and Italy and the forest fires in Greece. And then there's also a heat dome in China as well, causing record temperatures there. And those are all caused by this meandering jet. Misaligning that stream further north or further south at any one point, I'm not quite sure how that would cause a dome of heat to get trapped. But with this increased warming that we're seeing, you're basically getting these meanders and also the jet slows down. And so that makes these systems much more persistent. And what happens then is, of course, when these systems persist over land, so you might get the type of system that causes a heat dome, so you get sinking air in these systems, that actually is exacerbated by the drying out of the land surface below it. So you get these feedback effects from the land surface and more heat is released and it gets hotter and hotter and hotter when it stays in one place. I guess I just want to know whether the jet stream is a factor that's been taken into account in climate modelling. So climate models do reproduce the jet stream. But what studies have found is that in the future simulations of climate models, when we increase the number of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and we look at what happens to extreme weather events, these meandering jet streams don't become more frequent in these models. So, you know, that's something different from what we're seeing in the real world. There's kind of a problem there because we're not representing these processes well within climate models. So we could potentially be really underestimating the potential for impacts from these type of events. Hayley Fowler there. And as Hayley said, we've seen temperatures rise across the globe. Last Sunday, part of northwestern China reported a record breaking 52.2 degrees Celsius. China exports three point three trillion dollars of goods to the rest of the world. So a problematic and prolonged heat wave there could have unexpected consequences beyond China's borders. If factories in China are forced to close again, as they did during the Covid-19 pandemic, it could disrupt supply chains and lead to a shortage of some products in the UK that we take for granted, like furniture and toys. BBC correspondent Danny Vincent reports from Hong Kong. In 2022, China experienced the worst heat wave in 60 years. It put a strain on the already struggling Covid hit economy as factories across many provinces were forced to shut down production in order to save power. The heat wave led to soaring electricity use as hundreds of millions turned to air conditioners to stay cool. It coincided with severe droughts, crippling hydroelectric output. China then turned to burning more coal to fuel its energy needs, a move as seen as part of a potential climate change vicious circle. China is the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, but the prolonged heat waves have also threatened crop and livestock. The authorities are concerned that the extreme heat could potentially have an impact on the country's food security. Cities like Beijing have experienced some of the hottest consecutive days since records began. The global rise in temperatures is underpinning an urgency for better engagement with China in what's being called climate change diplomacy. Thanks, Danny. We know high temperatures may affect exports and the availability of certain foods on your supermarket shelves. Europe is also facing another threat making its way from Asia. Joe Lyon's professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine says disease also has the potential to spread as temperatures rise. And there is one particular problematic mosquito that is getting worryingly comfortable in the northern hemisphere. Warmer temperatures favour both the mosquitoes because they're tropical mosquitoes, they like it hot. And the infections they carry, that's because the infections need a time to develop inside the mosquito. And the rate of that development is temperature sensitive. The hotter the temperature, the quicker the parasite or the virus develops inside the mosquito. And so a larger proportion of those infections come through before the mosquito drops dead. Of course, temperatures are important, but globalisation and other factors are also important. Globalisation because that just increases the rate at which people travel from Europe to places where these infections are being transmitted all the time and come home again. That's what started the chikungunya epidemic in Italy in 2007, our biggest outbreak of locally transmitted mosquito-borne virus. That was transmitted by Aedes albopictus, which is the Asian tiger mosquito, the invasion into Europe of which is really probably the most important single trend that's going on. And it's the one that will in some places give you dengue or chikungunya or zika. It lives in East Asia, places like Korea, where winters are quite harsh. So it's not afraid of a cold winter. What it needs is a long, hot summer. And of course, our summers are getting hotter and longer. That mosquito has not yet established itself in South East England, but occasionally it gets detected and there's intervention to get it out. On the whole, in Europe, when the mosquito first arrives, it's just the mosquito. There isn't any infection yet. And often, because the mosquito has been left for a few years to establish itself, it's become locally adapted, it's found its local niche. When the virus arrives, as it did in Italy in 2007, there's a big outbreak of disease. People suddenly want to get rid of the mosquito, but now that's no longer possible. We need to make sure that we don't fall into that trap. Will we be able to keep this out forever? Well, perhaps not. If it's coming from all directions all the time, that surveillance becomes more and more and more difficult. Thanks to Jo Lyons. We heard earlier from Hayley Fowler how extreme weather events are becoming more severe and frequent as global temperatures rise. Most of this island has experienced summer thunderstorms recently, but you may also have had some near misses. Times when the forecasts and weather apps ring-fenced most of the British Isles in one of those yellow weather warnings and then not a drop of rain. In an attempt to improve the accuracy of these forecasts, an \u00a311m project called WESSEN, Wessex Convection Experiment, began last month. Producer Harry visited meteorologist Rob Thompson and senior researcher Natalie Harvey at Reading University as they released the project's debut set of weather balloons. We've got weights on the bottom. Those weights are judged so that we know how fast it will go up. We're aiming to get to 10km in just under an hour, so that's why we've got this much weight. So we basically fill the balloon until this is just starting to float with the weight. And how big is this going to get? Because it's already about a metre in diameter, isn't it? So you won't see it get much bigger than about a metre on the ground, but when it goes up, the pressure outside of the balloon is going to go down so the balloon starts getting bigger. They'll get to roughly the size of a small car, basically, then they'll burst. And exactly how high they get to when they burst is really variable. It depends basically on how good a balloon you happen to have got this time. So even with those weights on, it's just hovering. Let's just tie this off and then we'll be... There's a couple of people who have gone back into the office, but otherwise, four or five of us standing around. Is there a countdown normally? No. So the radios on the box of tricks hangs off the bottom by about 30 metres. Rob will slowly let the balloon up and that will unravel. Oh, that's fantastic. Spiralling out like a thread on a kite. And off it goes. Just like that. Yeah. So we've come and taken the weight off our legs and sat down over by the side of the... Atmospheric Observatory. At the Atmospheric Observatory. What's going on? Why are we sending these balloons up? So this is part of a big project called WESCON and we've got radars. Obviously the weather balloons like we're launching, there's drones, there's an aircraft that's flying through the storms and around the surrounding area. Am I missing anything, Natalie? Oh, I think we've got a glider as well. So there's quite a lot of weight behind this. There's loads of resources going into it. What are you trying to find out specifically? If you can predict a source of water on the hob will boil, it's really difficult to see where each bubble goes. And it's a lot like that with convection. So we can say we expect thunderstorms. We know that the bubbling is going to happen. The convective motion will happen. It's where precisely we're not very good at. So you end up with a warning, a third of England of thunderstorms where actually a lot of places will see very little. These days everyone has their app on their phone, which gives you the weather forecast in your postcode. And actually at the moment we don't have the forecast skill to be able to predict whether these storms are going to happen in your postcode or not. Obviously this is important day to day because if I know there's a thunderstorm, I'm probably not going to go out in it. But otherwise, are there bigger issues at hand or at play? Is there a reason why this could really help? Even just short scale notice can be enough to shut a tube station before it floods. You can save lives potentially there if you've got a good enough forecast with enough warning time. And when it comes to the historical records, I have the impression, and this might be quite naive, that flash floods or downpours and thunderstorms have become more common over the past, I don't know, 10, 15, 20 years. Is that something that is backed up by evidence or am I kind of making that up in my head? So there's certainly more reporting of big flash floods, thunderstorms and so on. It's difficult to be quite so certain that there's actually more happening. We do have data that says, for instance, the amount of rain falling in an individual days, that is going up. The more fine scale of how much rain you get in an hour or so from a thunderstorm is a bit more difficult. The data until fairly recently wasn't really reliable enough to make that kind of observation. We haven't really got a long time series to look back on. But the physics of why you would expect that to happen is pretty reasonable. Under a warmer atmosphere, then the air holds more water and there's just more energy as well from warmth. So for every degree warmer, we at least 7% more water in the rain and probably a bit more than that. And so we do expect bigger, stronger thunderstorms now than we did in the past. And that's still continuing as climate change continues. Rob Thompson and Natalie Harvey there. And Harry joins me in the studio for a catch up. So, Harry, how's it going? Yeah, I'm doing well, Marnie. And the project also appears to be doing well. The guys in Reading are sending up and launching a lot of balloons. So I did have a quick catch up with Natalie, who you just heard from slightly earlier, to find out if everything is still on track. So it's going really well. We're about half the way through now, so just over six weeks in. We've had about eight days of releasing the balloons, probably about 40 balloons in total. And, you know, Marnie, what's really interesting as well is the fact that it's not just them launching the balloons. So they have all these other resources, but it's other institutions across the UK like Leeds, Exeter University, Manchester and UCL. And some of those as well, they're also sending up balloons. So there's an awful lot of stuff going up in the sky. This is quite a big project. And when are the results expected to come in? Are they going to be able to forecast with more accuracy soon? Well, it's not going to be for a while. The data that they're collecting or the instrument underneath the balloon called the radio sound, that's taking readings of the pressure, humidity and temperature. And that data has started to come in. Again, Natalie can give you an update because obviously this is going to take quite a bit of time. It's expected to take about three years to kind of dissect it and look through it. And it will be even after that, it will be available for other researchers to look through and try and use to better understand these storms. So, you know, in summary, no, we're not going to get any forecasting in the immediate future. But hopefully this data set will allow us to start to understand the turbulent motions that form thunderstorms a little better and be able to pinpoint them. And I mean, talking about extreme weather events, I know that you, Marnie, have had your own scientific adventures chasing storms. You know, don't mean to brag, but I've actually been in an aeroplane into I flew into a hurricane in America once and we got to drop these little baton type things that they call them dropsons. And they collect all of this information like Natalie was talking about pressure, humidity. I just thought it was all done by satellite, but it's actually a lot more labor intensive. Yeah. I mean, you just said they're called dropsons. Does that mean they're literally parachuting them out of the plane? Yeah. That's fantastic. Yeah. So I flew all the way along the coast from Florida up to New York with NOAA. That stands for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, I think. So NOAA have these special planes that fly into hurricanes because that's what they need to actually check whether their predictions are right and whether these massive destructive weather events are going to go where they think they're going to go. And there's no shortcut for doing that other than taking a plane and dropping these little batons, these dropsons out during the journey. Yeah. I've got to say, Marnie, that's quite exotic and it sounds very exciting. I mean, I was very happy with going to Reading. Yeah, Harry, it starts with being happy going to Reading and then you're like, oh, I need more. I need a bigger fix. Right. Back to producing this week's show, Harry. Yeah, this was very exciting, but I should get back to it, shouldn't I? Thanks, Harry. Just a reminder, you're listening to Inside Science here on Radio 4 with me, Marnie Chesterton. And now we're heading over to Trowbridge near Bath to hear from Dr Stu Farramund. Over the past few weeks, he's got us thinking a bit more scientifically about the outside spaces surrounding our homes. Today, Stu tells us how our gardens can help fight the problems associated with climate change. The first thing I think about when I think about climate change is I think about carbon because we've got plants in our gardens, so surely we can use our plants to capture the carbon dioxide. The bad news is that you need to plant between 700 and a thousand trees every year just to offset the impact of a westerner's lifestyle. But you can make a difference. The first thing, the most important thing to do is to keep your garden. Just one square metre of concrete produces 260 kilograms of carbon dioxide. So whatever you do, don't concrete over your lawn and don't replace it with that horrible astroturf stuff. The things that you plant can make a difference in terms of capturing carbon. If you've got a mature tree, you might draw down between 20 and 35 kilograms of carbon every year. So that's equivalent to about two to three gallons of petrol. It's not a lot, but it does make a difference. The other thing that's important for gardens is that they can improve the air quality. On the covering of leaves and stems, there are tiny, tiny little hairs called trichomes and they're just about the right size that they can catch tiny particulate matter. And when it rains, it washes away and it really doesn't matter what plants they are, the more the better. Climate change is here to stay and as the summers get hotter and more extreme, plants play their part in cooling things down. Now, you know, when you're in the summertime and you're in the city, everybody flocks towards the fountains or to where there's any open water. And that's because water has a cooling effect to the air and the environment around it. Plants and trees also have the same effect because as plants draw water, moisture from the soil, they exude it out through the tiny little pores on the underside of the leaves called the stomata. And that actually has a profound cooling effect. In the peak of the summer, if you're beneath a canopy of leaves, you could feel 10 to 15 degrees cooler. Plants can also play their part in keeping buildings cool. Carpeting your roof with plants exudes moisture and has a cooling effect. This can reduce the summer highs on the top of the building from 60 degrees C down to 30 degrees C, reducing the energy consumption needed to keep the building cool by up to 25 percent. Perhaps the biggest thing that you can do today in your garden to help climate change is to start making compost. And I get a bit on my soapbox about this because we really shouldn't be throwing food into the bin. Every bit of food that goes into landfill basically doesn't break down, doesn't decay like it would do normally in the soil, and it ferments. And as it ferments, it produces methane. And methane is at least 60 times worse than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas. Get this right, for every kilogram of food that you put into the waste, it produces the equivalent of about two kilograms of carbon dioxide. That's like burning a litre of petrol. So just imagine that, burning a litre of petrol in your back garden every time you throw all those bendy carrots and those bread crusts away. Just make sure that you always put your food waste in the food waste bin. And if you don't have a food waste bin, find somebody who's making compost. If you make your own and you don't have a garden, give it to a neighbour and you'll have a friend for life. That was Dr Stu Farramund. On Monday this week, the Kirch Bridge, which links Russia to the Crimean Peninsula, was damaged by explosions. Two people died and a third was injured. This is the second attack on the bridge. Russia has blamed Ukraine for both and Ukraine has not taken responsibility. Early reports mentioned the use of uncrewed surface vessels, sort of like a marine drone, which could have been moved into positions under the bridge before being detonated. I wanted to know more about the latest tech used in naval warfare. How much have things moved on since those floating naval mines of over a hundred years ago? How deadly could our seas become? I spoke to Dr Siddarth Kaushal, a research fellow specialising in sea power at the Royal United Services Institute, or RUSI, and started by getting his opinion on what caused the Kirch Bridge explosion this week. Early indications suggest that the attack was conducted using an uncrewed surface vessel laden with explosives, not unlike some of the vessels the Ukrainians have used to harass Russian ships in and around Sevastopol, for example. Although given the size of the explosion and the likely payload, it might have carried a larger explosive payload. Of course, this is based on early indications. It would carry explosives along probably a pre-programmed route to the location where it was meant to detonate. At this point, if previous Ukrainian USVs are anything to go by, it might well connect to an operator to provide a full video link of what it was looking at. We've seen previous USVs use things like Starlink antennae to allow this sort of remote control. And this allows designation of a particular target and for detonation at the appropriate point. OK, so you've got your sea drone and then you've got someone with a line of sight on it or some sort of connection to where it is, maybe GPS, who can tell when it's got to where it needs to be, who then pushes the button. I would presume not line of sight, because obviously that then puts the operator at some risk. But yeah, presumably through satellite links, operators at some distance could assess whether it was in the general vicinity of its target and probably use an onboard sensor, for example, an electro-optical imager to identify and then guide it to its precise target. What sort of things can these attack drones attack? What are their limitations? They can attack a whole range of targets from, you know, vessels at sea to infrastructure, as we've seen. In terms of their limitations, there's a few. So firstly, they have fairly narrow fields of view. So while they're quite effective at targeting either fixed infrastructure that's not going anywhere or vessels that are in known locations, for example, harbors, actually finding a mobile dynamic target at sea with one of these things and attacking it would probably prove quite difficult. Not impossible. The Ukrainians have targeted at least one Russian vessel at sea with an uncrewed surface vessel, the Ivan Kerr's intelligence gathering ship. But this is a comparatively difficult task. The second challenge is that there are some fairly quick fixes. For example, you know, the Russians have built barriers across harbors to block access for these USVs. And, you know, things like attack helicopters can also be used to destroy them. You know, the Ukrainians built these uncrewed surface vessels that would appear using quite a lot of commercial off-the-shelf capabilities, you know, a propulsion system derived from a civilian jet ski, for example, and possibly Starlink and TNF with things like guidance from a foreign and identification during the vessel's final approach to its target. So these uncrewed surface vessels tend to attack stationary targets. It's quite difficult for them to to attack a moving target. And a way around that might be some very old technology. I'm talking about mines and Ukraine and Russia seem to be using a new generation of mines that I've heard described as the workhorse of naval strategy. These new ones aren't the ones that float about anchored in place. They they seem to sit on the seabed. Can we talk about that? There's a range of mines that the Ukrainians and the Russians have deployed both for defensive and offensive purposes. Some of them quite old, but still quite effective Soviet era mines. But increasingly, you find navies around the world shifting to slightly more sophisticated approaches. So you might think as examples of mines like the US Navy's CAPTA or its more recent Hammerhead mine, which would have been planted, as you said, on seabeds and would use things like acoustic sensors on board to discriminate targets of interest. For example, submarines or surface vessels. How's that work? So every vessel has a unique acoustic signature based on things like its propulsion system and size. It's certainly not easy, but it's within the reach of technology and has been for some time to distinguish the signature, say, a very quiet submarine from a really noisy cargo vessel that happens to be passing overhead, essentially by using things like acoustic sensors or magnetic anomaly detectors, which is another way to differentiate naval vessels from other kinds of surface vessels because the size and hull structure creates a different type of magnetic anomaly. What you can create is a more discriminating system, which is quite useful if you don't want to waste assets on targets that are A, not of interest, and B, might cause international blowback if you do hit them. But many modern mines are also remotely activated. So something like the hammerhead, to go back to the American example, can theoretically be placed in international waters within the boundaries of international law. The bridge was attacked on Monday, and this week Russia also said that it would not renew the grain deal, which is a deal that allowed Ukrainian grain barges to pass through the Black Sea. And it means Ukraine's going to need to find alternate routes for its grain exports. What are your thoughts on how that could pan out? Yeah, so I think there's a few variables that will probably determine how it pans out. So the first will be the attitude of Ukraine's partners, but in particular the Turkish, in terms of how they view efforts to retain the, well, at least what remains of the grain deal on a basis that perhaps excludes Russia. Are they willing to provide security guarantees for vessels? Are they willing to engage in efforts such as convoying? And indeed, are the Turks willing to admit or encourage extra-regional navies to engage in such efforts? So I think the attitude of the Turkish will probably be a significant factor as well as Ukraine's partners. The second will be if a convoying effort did occur, whether the actual numbers of hulls required for this sort of activity could be generated given the other commitments. Some of Ukraine's partners have particularly those with global commitments. And, you know, convoying is a very resource-intensive activity. But I think the most important player perhaps will actually be the insurance industry, because ultimately if premiums on shipping in the Black Sea, the northern Black Sea, rise to a point where it's not economical to do so, then it's actually not really relevant whether, you know, channels have been cleared through the mines or whether a military support to vessels transiting will occur, because there will be nothing to protect. Very few sort of vessels will deem this commercially viable. So the risk appetite of the insurance industry and how it views developments going forward will I think be perhaps the most important factor. Thank you, Siddharth Kaushal.
